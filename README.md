# Machine-Learning with python

Machine Learning and data visualisation is made easy with Python and it's numerous libraries such as scikit-learn, 
matplotlib, numpy and pandas. I used these to analyse data from the internet and used unsupervised and supervised 
learning algorithms such as K-Nearest-Neighbours and Random Forests to classify data into relevant classes they belong 
to without the errors of overfitting. This was done in a Cambridge Coding course in London.
